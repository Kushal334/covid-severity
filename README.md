## Predicting COVID-19 Pneumonia Severity on Chest X-ray with Deep Learning

ðŸ›‘ NOT FOR MEDICAL USE ðŸ›‘ 

There are now two datasets:

1. Scored severity for the COVID-19 Image Data Collection Dataset is here: [Pneumonia severity scores for 94 images](https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset/blob/master/annotations/covid-severity-scores.csv)
2. Stonybrook Radiographic Assessment of Lung Opacity (RALO) dataset is here: [Pneumonia severity scores for 2373 images](https://zenodo.org/record/4634000)

The scores are explained as follows for the RALO dataset:
  - **geographic_extent_mean**: The extent of lung involvement by ground glass opacity or consolidation for each lung (right lung and left lung separately) was scored as: 0 = no involvement; 1 = <25% involvement; 2 = 25-50% involvement; 3 = 50-75% involvement; 4 = >75% involvement. The total extent score ranged from 0 to 8 (right lung and left lung together). 
  - **opacity_mean**: The degree of opacity for each lung (right lung and left lung separately) was scored as: 0 = no opacity; 1 = ground glass opacity; 2 = consolidation; 3 = mix of consolidation and ground glass opacity (>50% consolidation); 4 = white-out. The total opacity score ranged from 0 to 8 (right lung and left lung together). NOTE: The total opacity score ranged from 0 to 6 for the COVID-19 Image Data Collection Dataset so scalling (like opacity/6\*8) will align the two datasets.
